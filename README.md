This project was created as part of a semester work. This interpreter works with some standard commands like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NEG, ROR, ROL, 
MOVA (move to address), MOVR (move to register) JMP, EQU, SBRS, SBRC. But also supports constants, comments and labels.

I'm sorry, but you'll have to suffer :C
